# Project Milestone M1

_Last updated: October 3, 2025_

Your project has three milestones (see [project README](./README.md)), and this handout concerns the first milestone, named M1.
It covers the first two Sprints (S1 and S2).

## Due Date

Friday 17.10.2025 at 08:45

## Overview

Milestone M1 will provide you with feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. 
Consistent delivery of value every Sprint is an essential ingredient for your success in this and any other project. 
M1's goal is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers&mdash;this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills.

We encourage you to solicit informal feedback from your coaches on how you are doing; your coaches are an important resource that you should leverage for your success. 
Aside from the weekly meeting, reach out to them on Discord, email, or any other mutually agreed upon communication channel for receiving feedback.
The whole staff is committed to helping you.

We will proactively give you such informal feedback on PRs and code reviews.
We will not stress you with a grade every Sprint, but you should nevertheless aim for all your _finalized_ PRs and code reviews to be of the highest quality, as they are an integral part of your individual performance.
Intermediate PRs and code reviews need not live to those high expectations, of course.

## M1 Deliverables

Do not think of the milestone as some big deadline where you turn in everything you've done so far.
Instead, you should view it like any other Sprint Review: a checkpoint on the way to your final goal.
We provide below a list of items that your _team_ will need to prepare for M1, in order to make sure you're on-track:

1. Figma of the main user flows (wireframes, mockups, and screen linking between mockup screens<sup>1</sup>) ➡︎ on _figma.com_, linked from your project's GitHub wiki
2. Architecture diagram<sup>2</sup> ➡︎ _your GitHub wiki_
3. Product Backlog<sup>3</sup> ➡︎ _your GitHub Scrum board_
4. Sprint Backlog<sup>3</sup> for S3 ➡︎ _your GitHub Scrum board_
5. Code repo with configured CI, analyzed by Sonar, tested with at least 1 meaningful end-to-end test, and >80% line test coverage ➡︎ _GitHub_
6. Working, stable APK that features a first meaningful end-to-end user flow<sup>4</sup> ➡︎ _GitHub Actions artifacts_
7. Scrum process documents<sup>5</sup> ➡︎ _provided Google sheets_, shared with swent-staff@dslab.org
   - one documented stand-up meeting for S2 (you can pick any one of the ≥2 stand-ups you do)
   - documented Sprint Retrospective for S2

Additionally, each _individual_ team member should prepare the following:

1. An individual Retrospective for S2<sup>5</sup> ➡︎ _provided Google sheet_, shared with swent-staff@dslab.org only
2. Code<sup>6</sup>: ≥2 PRs, merged into `main` latest by the M1 deadline ➡︎ _GitHub_
3. Reviews: ≥2 reviewed PRs, completed latest 24 hours before the M1 deadline ➡︎ _GitHub_

Further details on some of the deliverables appear below.

### <sup>1</sup> Figma

We suggest that you start with wireframes, and then create full mockups whose screens are linked together, so that you can test out the user flow and build a shared understanding within your team of what the application should look like. This will make it easier to define clear development tasks.

For the M1 deliverable, create a named version called "M1" on figma.com, copy the link from the version history, and put it in your wiki.
Make sure the Figma is accessible to everyone.
Do not use a different name than the one indicated above.

### <sup>2</sup> Architecture Diagram

Start thinking about the overall design of your app. Familiarize yourself with the [Android App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/intro) guide, and then draft the UI and data layers. This will help you understand what dependencies you need to take into account when building your app.

It is still early, so we don't expect you to deliver a finalized architecture diagram in M1. However, we do want to see that you have put time into thinking about the overall architecture and the relations between its different screens, data sources, and internal state. Put this diagram in your wiki.

Here is an example in the spirit of the Android App Architecture guide. The Domain layer may or may not be applicable to your app. 
You can use whatever drawing software you want (e.g., [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)), as long as the diagram displays when viewing your wiki with a standard Web browser.
We recommend you put the source file under version control.

### <sup>3</sup> Product and Sprint Backlogs (PB and SB)

As you approach M1, you should have a PB with clear, fine-grained high-priority user stories at the top; all user stories for your first epic should be worked out in reasonable detail.
Try to think about another epic too, and break it down into user stories; it's OK for the user stories at the bottom of the PB to be coarse-grained, since the PO may not flesh out in too much detail features that could drop from the PB before release.

> [!NOTE]
> The maintenance of the PB is the responsibility of the PO. You need to wear the PO (not Dev) hat when you work on the PB. Early on, the coaches may exercise some PO muscle as well, to get you used to the separation between PO and Dev team.

For M1, we will snapshot the PB and SB you have in GitHub at the deadline.

### <sup>4</sup> Working, Stable APK

You must set up your repo with a GitHub workflow to build the app's APK such that, at the end of every Sprint, you can create a new release at the push of a button. For M1, your coaches must be able to install the APK on their Android phone and manually navigate around your app. The app should start without a hitch, and the completed features should work bug-free.

> [!NOTE]
> You might find yourself with functionality that is to-be-defined or simply not robust enough for M1. That is fine. What is not fine is for the app to misbehave&mdash;at the very least, have a Toast or Snackbar indicating that a particular function is not yet supported.

For M1, link from your wiki the GitHub Actions workflow run that has the M1 APK in its artifacts; we will download the APK from the run's Artifacts section. 

Consider creating a [release branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) called "M1" so that you have a clean snapshot of all code and assets related to M1.

> [!WARNING]
> Teams sometimes struggle to produce a working APK by M1: they have major bugs, missing essential functionality, etc. Producing a working APK is hard, and you should not leave it to the last minute. Aim to have a working APK for each Sprint Review, and then M1 will not take you by surprise.


### <sup>5</sup> Scrum Process Documents

We will provide you with sheets to use for Scrum documents; they will be generated from these templates: [team Retrospective](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Scw9H9x-m2Ue3kqGR0Y10nk-AoFeXjbhkP8qfJGbLWg/), [individual Restrospective](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zvfk-e8ud2JS7aSrzbB6PvMwZMKHZJ5dGX_2d9H3n_c/), and [Stand-Up minutes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOuHWkrDlnK3JX6Uul9xdvNUBkIx59fRShO3YuWcXDA/).

We will judge positively your team Retrospective if you identify mistakes and problems, and then come up with ways to improve.
Every team, no matter how professional, faces challenges and gets things wrong occasionally.
The good teams realize this, introspect, and improve; the poor teams remain oblivious and deteriorate with time.

In the Google sheets we provide you, there is a separate tab for each Sprint. The document can contain sensitive information and should be shared solely with your team and swent-staff@dslab.org.

The individual Retrospective is SwEnt-specific, not part of Scrum.
Just like with teams, any top-tier professional uses introspection to learn and improve, so do take this seriously.
Make sure the individual Retrospective is accessible only to you and the course staff.
It should nevertheless be linked from your team's wiki.

### <sup>6</sup> Coding

You will do PRs for all sorts of things.

We emphasize _code_ PRs here because, in the context of SwEnt, we're mostly interested in seeing code contributions that enhance functionality, reliability, security, performance, etc.
Good graphic design, choice of colors and themes, and visual aesthetics are important in a real-world product, and you should devote to them their fair share of attention in your app, but they are peripheral to what we evaluate in SwEnt.
PRs for tasks like Figma, architecture documents, or setting up GitHub and Firebase are important contributions.
Nevertheless, each team member must contribute a minimum amount of pure coding, hence this choice of a minimum number of code PRs.

At the same time, every _responsible_ team member will also contribute non-code PRs, and these will be taken into account under a separate category (see below).

Sometimes students work together on a PR.
This is fine.
However, in SwEnt, we assume that there is one person coding for each PR, and thus the main credit will go the person creating the PR.

## Grading

> [!NOTE]
> In SwEnt, the emphasis of grading is more on process, and less on features or the beauty of the UI.  These are of course important factors, but keep in mind that building an Android app in SwEnt is mainly a pretext to learn the process of how to turn ideas into products, as a team.

The breakdown of the team / individual grades for M1 will be as follows:

</table>

> [!NOTE]
> Late submissions will be penalized 2% per hour of lateness. For example, a submission that is 1 day late and is worth the full 100 points will be reduced to 52 points, i.e., will incur a 24h x 2% = 48% penalty. The rule applies to both team and individual submissions.

> [!NOTE]
> It is the team's collective responsibility to submit the team deliverables on time.  For example, if Eva is tasked to submit the deliverables by the deadline, and she doesn't do it because of a medical emergency or because her laptop exploded, the team is not absolved from this responsibility.  You must put in place backup mechanisms to account for unexpected circumstances.

<sup>7</sup> M1 is about ensuring that you start working effectively as a team; we aim to give you personalized feedback, to help you grow. In addition to the quality of the code merged, a code PR's quality also includes whether you follow the best practices taught in lectures: Does the PR have a clear goal and description? Does it have a single purpose (e.g., does not mix unrelated things in one PR)? Does it align with the task's definition of done?

<sup>8</sup> Our evaluation of the quality of a code review has two dimensions: First, the technical aspects, i.e., did the review identify all serious problems with the PR and help improve it? Second, the "collegiality" component: Is the feedback phrased in a constructive way? Are the suggestions useful and humble? Does the review focus on the code not the person?
Since it takes some practice to get reviews right, we will only grade the quality of the ones you do in S2, after you've already given and received a few reviews in S1.  
Use S1 as an opportunity to learn how to do this well.

<sup>9</sup> This refers to your active participate in the [Scrum ceremonies](Ceremonies.md) that take place on Friday.
Being present and contributing to each of the three ceremonies is essential.

<sup>10</sup> This evaluates how responsible you are as a team member. Have you properly fulfilled your Developer, PO and/or Scrum Master tasks?
Did you do everything that could reasonably be done to ensure the successful completion of your tasks and of the team's as a whole?
Were you responsive in dealing with blockers?

What "being responsible" means depends on circumstances:

- you might finish the task yourself; or
- ask for help in a timely fashion when you're stuck or unavailable, so the team can move ahead; or
- bring up the challenges latest at the next stand-up meeting; or
- ask your coaches for help if your team is stuck and everything you tried has failed; or
- bring the serious blockers for discussion in the Retrospective and/or Planning meetings; or
- finish what can be finished, and discuss a change of strategy for what remains
- ...

What we want to see here is that you've truly done your best, given the time budget for this course.
You might not have succeeded in all your undertakings (that's ok, one can't always win), but what matters is that you tried in an active manner to find solutions.
