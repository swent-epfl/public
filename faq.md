## How can I get help?

There are three ways to get your questions answered: on your own, your peers, or the SwEnt staff.
In real life, it is primarily on your own that you find answers, and next in line is your peers.
While still a student, the course staff is here to help, but most importantly they are here to prepare you to be self-sufficient in the real world.
There are several methods to get help in SwEnt:

1. We teach you several methods for how to find information on your own self-sufficiency. The first step is to use online resources on your own (documentation, tutorials, etc.) to understand the context around your question and its answer.  Web search provides a good way to find answers, though the context may be missing. LLMs provide excellent starting points in your search, because they can understand the broader context of your question, but their answers can occasionally be the result of hallucinations.
2. The next step is to post your question on Ed. Here you would get help from your peers, as well as the course staff. You can even post anonymously to your peers, if you are shy (though the staff always knows the identity of the poster). The most effective way to get help is to explain what you have already done to try and answer the question on your own &ndash; if others see that you invested time in getting an answer, they will be more willing to invest their time too in helping you find the answer.
3. If this fails, reach out to your coaches. The same criterion as above applies: explain what you have done to solve the problem on your own.
4. If the coaches cannot help, then email swent-staff@dslab.org.
5. If you have a private matter that you wish to discuss exclusively with Prof. Candea (e.g., a personal situation that is affecting you emotionally), then send him emails directly.

The SwEnt staff is here to help you become someone who successfully solves the world's problems using software.
Providing you with the right amount of support (and not more at the right point in time (an not earlier) is central to our pedagogical mission.

## Can we use a different tech stack than Kotlin/Jetpack?

We are open to making exceptions to the Kotlin/Jetpack policy, as long as you make a good case for it.

Doing your project using a different framework/language entails several risks that you should carefully assess ahead of time:

- Coaches and course staff will not be able to help you with technical challenges as well as they can with Kotlin/Jetpack, so you may often find yourself on your own
- Integration with various tools and services (e.g., Sonar Cloud for measuring line coverage and cognitive complexity) could be tricky for the tech stack you choose, so check ahead of time that you will be able to complete the deliverables for all project milestones. We will not grant exceptions for lack of compatibility with your chosen framework/language.
- Evaluation of your work may end up being less precise, depending on the coaches' familiarity with the tech stack you chose.

If you wish to use something other than Kotlin/Jetpack, email swent-staff@dslab.org asap.
We will then assess whether your _entire_ team wishes to adopt a different framework/language, whether doing so will be beneficial to the students and the project, and whether we have staff who can coach you if you use that framework/language.

## Why does SwEnt use curving?

The form of curving we use in SwEnt helps normalize the scores to adapt to the difficulty/ease of the milestone, and it provides a consistent method for evaluating performance across different cohorts (so that a grade of X in SwEnt means the same thing this year as it will next year). The manual thresholding we do mitigates the effect of extreme scores, so that outliers don't skew the grades.

We do spend a lot of time making sure that the grades are computed fairly, and we rely on more than a decade of experience teaching this course.
By now, we have converged onto the fairest and most correct grading scheme we can think of for a course like this one. 
We do however always want to hear arguments for how the grading (or any aspect of the course) can be improved; many of the changes we made were actually ideas we got from students.
So if you think there is a better way to grade, then please present a well thought-out pros/cons analysis, and perhaps that will convince us to do things otherwise.

## Can we do the Scrum ceremonies in French?

All Scrum ceremonies are to be done in English, even if everyone in the team and the coaches speak French.

The reason is that you will have to be fluent in English if you are to be competitive as a software engineer. 
In your career, you will inevitably be part of multi-lingual, multi-cultural teams in which the lingua franca will be English. 
So, alongside learning Scrum, Kotlin, Android, etc. we want you to learn how to communicate with other software developers in English.

## Which absences are excusable?

You already have [2 joker passes](README.md), which should account for most instances. For the rest, see below.

Conflicts with other courses or exams are not excusable absences. The dates of midterms and final exams are announced at the start of the semester, so it is your responsibility to identify conflicts early and work on a solution with the staffs of the involved courses.

- Draw the analogy to physics/biology labs

The exceptions listed in the _Absence aux épreuves_ section of the [official EPFL policy](https://www.epfl.ch/education/studies/reglement-et-procedure/questions-frequentes/inscriptions-cours-examens-retirer/) apply to the weekly SwEnt Scrum ceremonies as well. Just contact swent-staff@dslab.org with the relevant certificate to make suitable arrangements.

## Why don't you count in my grade the hours I invest?

Grades reflect the quality and outcomes of the work rather than the time invested; the degree of learning and skill acquired is measured by meeting (and exceeding) project requirements. In professional software development, the focus is on delivering results efficiently, so taking a long time to deliver a good result is actually not rewarded in the real world, quite the opposite. In SwEnt, we try to get you used to this concept. 

It is for this reason that we spend so much time in Lecture 1 discussing how to become a master of your tools, adopt best practices to optimize your workflow rather than just putting in more hours, and how to seek and get help. A big part of your professional development is to learn how to manage time effectively and work efficiently; this skill is crucial not only in software development but in and many other fields. A client (or an employer) will care about the functionality, usability, and quality of your output, not how long it took you to develop it.

## Why is presence at the weekly Scrum ceremonies mandatory?

After having studied remotely during COVID, this is a natural question you might ask yourself.
The key thing to realize is that this is the first time you get to develop software collaboratively in a large team, and this involves many challenges. SwEnt's raison d'être is to teach you how to handle these challenges before you go out in the real world and face them for real. What works for teams of 2-3 people rarely works for teams of 6-7 people. And, while working as a team in-person is hard, working as a team _remotely_ is even harder. Here are a few reasons:

__Problem solving and brainstorming__: Complex issues will come up inevitably. Such issues are solved more quickly through in-person discussions, where ideas can flow organically, preferably in front of a (real) whiteboard. Nuances can be clarified in real-time. In-person interaction leads to high-bandwidth communication, in contrast to instant messaging or Slack. There's a reason why Slack added a "huddle" feature, but even that falls far short of real in-person work. SwEnt has a huge workload, and you cannot afford the inefficiencies introduced by remote participation.

__Work efficiency__: Physical presence plus discipline enhance focus and participation; working from home introduces distractions. Sharing screens is clunky and inefficient. A good example is hackathons: having a 5-hour hackathon in-person every week is far more efficient than being on Slack for 1h every day.

__Team cohesion__: Face-to-face interactions build trust, camaraderie, and a sense of shared purpose among team members. This leads to a more positive and collaborative environment, which in turn helps overcome the inevitable hurdles that will show up. Teams where some of the members are remote will inevitably fragment and, by the end of the semester, break apart.  Humans are social beings, and in-person interactions are key to us functioning properly.
We recommend that you meet in-person more frequently during the start of the semester, and then switch to at least a couple of times a week in the second half of the semester, once your team has gels.

__Fun__: Working with your team in-person leads to spontaneous interactions and the ability to directly observe and engage with peers’ work, which leads to serendipitous learning moments. In-person collaboration makes it easy to pair-program, troubleshoot together, and share insights in real-time. It's a lot more fun to learn together than separately. In remote settings, technical issues, an incomplete view of each other, and communication barriers make it hard for people to create a rapport.

__Mindshare__: Achieving mindshare is one the most important goals of a team, and in-person interaction is by far the easiest way to accomplish this. Mindshare leads to smoother and more efficient operations, helps avoid misunderstandings, and provides strong incentives to resolve conflicts. Misunderstandings and conflicts are the classic undoings of teams.

__Accountability and motivation__: Regular in-person meetings help ensure everyone stays on track, identify potential roadblocks early, and motivate the team members. A central part of Scrum, the agile method we practice in SwEnt, is the daily standup, and the role of this standup is to get everyone on the same page and keep the team members accountable and motivated. Improved distribution of workload: In-person discussions facilitate a fairer and more transparent process of assigning responsibilities and adjusting load. You will make estimates during sprint planning, but these estimates have serious margins of error, and thus need to be adjusted during the sprint.
_You must learn to walk before you run._

When moving from in-person interaction to online interaction, teams lose something very precious: non-verbal communication. This includes facial expressions (smiles, frowns, raised eyebrows, etc.), body language (posture, gestures, eye contact, etc.), paralanguage (tone of voice, pitch, volume, pace), touch (handshakes, pats on the back, etc.), and appearance. Humans have evolved to use all these in order to transmit information to each other. In teams, non-verbal communication builds trust and rapport, and non-verbal cues offer insights beyond spoken words (e.g., body language and tone of voice reveal a person's true emotions, leading to a better understanding of their message and potential concerns; much of this is lost over Zoom or Discord). Non-verbal communication enhances collaboration: nodding, gestures, and mirroring body language signal agreement, engagement, and active listening, making discussions more productive and inclusive. Non-verbal signals prevent misunderstandings, especially in cross-cultural teams. We realize that many of you may be unaware of this, because you had the misfortune of starting your university studies during the Covid pandemic that imposed remote learning.

The meeting between your team and the coaches also must be in-person, and here are some of the reasons:

- Clearer guidance and feedback: Direct, face-to-face communication allows for immediate clarification of project requirements, expectations, and detailed feedback on progress. Our staff have been thoroughly trained for such in-person debriefs and feedback sessions. Participating via zoom will be a tremendous loss both to the team and to the remote individual.
- Building mentor relationships: In-person meetings foster a stronger connection between the student team and staff, leading to more personalized mentorship and support.
Resolving conflicts proactively: Potential misunderstandings or conflicts can be addressed quickly and constructively in face-to-face settings, preventing escalation. The staff are trained to pick up early signals of conflicts; these signals are likely to get lost in the case of remote attendance.
- Demonstration of commitment and professionalism: In-person meetings signify the team's dedication and value for the staff's time and expertise. As mentioned in lecture, our staff have already invested hundreds of person-hours to prepare for this course, and they are very motivated to help you become the most accomplished and competitive professionals you can be.

It is impossible for an engineer to be effective at remote collaboration before becoming effective at in-person collaboration. This is not only the conclusion of scientific studies but also our own personal conclusion. First, over the years we've been teaching this course, we found that the teams where members skip meetings or do not engage fully with the rest of the members are precisely the teams that have serious collaboration problems and lead to the formation of cliques – the typical outcome is failure of the entire team. And there are no winners on a losing team. Second, our friends and peers who are currently managing large software organizations are observing that recent graduates really need to be present in the office to become effective as part of a team (and they are referring to engineers who have already graduated with a Masters, who have more project experience than SwEnt students).

While we realize that some of you live far from campus, you must keep in mind that this is a personal choice you made. There may have been good reasons or less good reasons behind it, but the fact remains that, when this comes in conflict with the quality of the education you receive, you must make another personal choice: do you prioritize your education or your current living situation? Covid has already put your generation at a disadvantage; perpetuating this disadvantage through continued remote studying is a mistake. SwEnt aims to teach you how to work as a team in-person, and this must come before you can operate as a team remotely.

If you look at the software industry, the past year has marked a shift from the peak of fully-remote work towards a greater degree of in-person interaction, trending toward a hybrid model. Companies that initially went fully remote have experienced challenges with long-term remote work (in particular w.r.t. collaboration and the sense of belonging), which has led them to revise their policies to encourage more in-person time, even though this means an increase in costs for leasing office space. We implement such a hybrid approach in SwEnt: there is one time period (Friday morning) when you are required to invariably be on-campus, and the other days of on-campus activities with your team can be scheduled at the convenience of the team. When scheduling this in-person time, keep in mind that your primary goal at this point is to get the best education you can, because it is the best investment you can make for your future.
