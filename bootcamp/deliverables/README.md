# Deliverables

The Bootcamp consists of three milestones, each one with its own set of deliverables to be pushed to your individual repository according to the following deadlines:

- [B1: Environment setup and getting started with Android](B1/README.md) due on 15-Sep at 23:59
- [B2: Building a ToDo app](B2/README.md) due on 23-Sep at 23:59
- [B3: Third-party APIs and test coverage](B3/README.md) due on 29.09.2025 at 23:59

The steps you follow as you complete the three milestones will guide you from the basics to more advanced concepts of Android development. Good luck, and happy coding!

## Submitting your Deliverables

On 8.09.2025, we will create your individual repo  containing an initial template for your Bootcamp.
You can access this repository at `https://github.com/swent-epfl/bootcamp-25-<your GitHub username>`, where `<your GitHub username>` is the GitHub username you provided to us through Moodle.
You should receive an invitation to join the repository by email sent to your EPFL address.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you submitted your GitHub ID [using Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1341689).

For the submission of each milestone, you will commit your changes to this repository.
We will only use GitHub to manage your submissions.
For each milestone, we will grade your submission by analyzing and testing the code on the `main` branch.
We will take into account the latest commit you made and pushed before the deadline of each milestone.
Any changes committed and pushed to the repo after the deadline will not be taken into account; please do not ask for exceptions.

Make sure that you merge any changes from other branches to `main` before the deadline of each milestone.
Commit and push often, in order to avoid any bad surprises (loss of connectivity, equipment problem, etc.).

## Grading

We will grade your Bootcamp automatically by running a series of tests on your code.
There are two types of tests:

- the _public tests_, which are already available in the Bootcamp repository
- the _staff tests_, which are private and will be used only for grading

To make sure that we can run our tests on your code, we provide you a skeleton of the app.
You can modify the skeleton, as long as you keep the original signatures of the provided classes, methods, and functions.
The Bootcamp template contains for you a signature check file `sigchecks/SignatureChecks.kt` to ensure that you do not modify the signatures of the provided code.
If you modify any signature, building your app will fail, which will ultimately result in earning 0 points.

> [!NOTE]
> You are free to add any file/class/function you want to the project.
> You can add any default parameters/properties to the provides functions/classes.
> For example, if a function `foo(a: Int)` is provided, you can change it to `foo(a: Int, b: String = "default")`.
> However, make sure to not modify the name of the existing parameters/properties.

For each bootcamp milestone, we will grade the quality of your commit messages.
Make sure you read this [guide on how to write good commit messages](/bootcamp/docs/CommitMessages.md) before starting the Bootcamp.
