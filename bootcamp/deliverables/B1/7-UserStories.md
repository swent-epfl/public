# User Stories

As you saw in the lectures, user requirements are often written as **user stories**[^1].  
They describe the desired functionality from the end user's perspective and help you focus on what matters to them.

In this bootcamp, you will implement features based on the following user stories:

- As a user, I want to sign up and log into the app, so that my ToDos are kept across devices.  
- As a user, I want to create a new ToDo, so that I can add new tasks to my list.  
- As a user, I want to view a list of my ToDos, so that I can easily see all my pending tasks at once.  
- As a user, I want to edit and view details of my ToDos, so that I can update tasks or review their detailed descriptions.  
- As a user, I want to add locations to my ToDos and see them on a map, so that I can plan my work based on where tasks are.  

We provide these initial stories to give you a sense of the ToDo app.  
Now it’s your turn: **write two new user stories** that extend or improve the app. Think about what you would expect from a ToDo app!

## Requirements

- Write **2 new user stories**, different from the ones above.  
- Add them to the file **`userStories.txt`** at the root of your bootcamp repository.  
- Each line must contain exactly one complete user story.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Make sure that each line contains exactly one user story.
>
> Example of valid `userStories.txt` file:
>
> ```markdown
> 1   As a user, I want to sign up and log into the app, so that my ToDos are kept across devices.
> 2   As a user, I want to create a new ToDo, so that I can add new tasks to my list.
> ```
